"""Compare two artifact JSONs within a numeric tolerance (ignoring `generated_at`).

CI uses this instead of an exact `git diff` so the committed artifact is checked against a fresh
pipeline run without tripping on last-decimal float wobble across platforms — while still catching
real drift (a hand-edited number, a changed string, a structural change).

    uv run python -m pipeline.artifact_check OLD.json NEW.json

Numbers must match within REL_TOL/ABS_TOL; everything else (strings, structure, null) must match
exactly.
